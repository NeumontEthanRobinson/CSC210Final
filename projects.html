            <h2>Number Guessing Game</h2>
            <p>I made a working number guessing game that allows the player to chose from 4 difficulties: Easy, Medium,
                Hard, and Custom.
                Each difficulty controls the range of numbers and the amount of guesses allowed. The custom difficulty
                allows the player to choose those values for themselves.
            </p>

            <h2>Text Based RPG</h2>
            <p>I made a RPG that uses java to make a text based battle system and enviroment. It includes a class
                creation system with 6 classes for the player.
                It includes a wide variety of weapons and armor for the player to use. You can battle through 15
                different enemies that are selected use a weighted rng system.
                Each encounter ends in a reward of either weapons or armor.

            <h2>The Midnight Chronicles,
                Case #1: The Reels of Death </h2>
            <p>This is a work in progress project based on a friend's D&D system and campaign. In this game you will go
                through Las Vegas whilst trying to solve
                a mystery involving a mysterious creature that the most people can remember is the sound of a roulette
                wheel clicking. Escape from this creature
                and working with a benefactor to eventually take it down.
